# Homer
To find an optimal size of different components of an off-grid PV system in the HOMER software with different types of batteries (lead-acid batteries and lithium-ion batteries). The proposed model shows the optimal size of the off-grid PV system with regard to eligibility criteria for various types of batteries and the net present cost (NPC). The observed off grid PV system consists of PV modules, a load, a converter and batteries and it is modelled in the HOMER software.
